    "# Feature Specification: Real-time alerts for regulatory violations## Feature OverviewThis feature involves the implementation of real-time alerts for regulatory violations related to suspicious activity or claims events in the financial industry. The feature should allow users, specifically financial analysts, to receive real-time alerts when a regulatory violation occurs based on predefined rules and criteria. The user should be able to take immediate action to address the potential issue, based on the information provided in the real-time alert. ## Functional Requirements- The system should store rules and criteria for suspicious activity and claims events in a database, based on client inputs and requirements.- When a regulatory violation occurs based on predefined rules and criteria, such as suspicious activity or claims events, the system should generate a real-time alert.- The real-time alert should be configurable to include details such as the type of violation, the relevant financial entity, and the severity of the violation.- The real-time alerts should be generated and received within seconds of a regulatory violation occurring.- The system should define a protocol for handling real-time alerts, which may involve escalation procedures, designated response teams, or other measures to address the potential issue.- The user should be able to take immediate action to address the potential issue, based on the information provided in the real-time alert.- The real-time alert should include details such as the type of suspicious activity/claims event, the financial entity involved, the location of the activity, and any other relevant information that can help the user take prompt action.## Technical Design- The backend of the system will be developed using Spring Boot, with a focus on integrating microservices architecture. - RESTful API endpoints will be designed and implemented, adhering to best practices. - MongoDB will be integrated with defined schemas and collections optimized for performance.- The front end of the system will be developed using React.js, using UI components and managing state with Redux or Context API.- The system will be designed to be responsive, cross-browser compatible, and optimized for performance with lazy loading.- The system will be integrated with Eureka or Consul for service discovery and Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management.- APIs will be documented using Swagger/OpenAPI, with versioning and deprecation strategies in place to ensure clear and maintainable API documentation for developers.## Non-Functional Requirements- The system should generate real-time alerts within seconds of a regulatory violation occurring.- The system should allow users to take immediate action to address potential issues, reducing the risk of financial loss or reputational damage.- The system should be designed with performance, scalability, and security in mind, to ensure efficient and secure processing of sensitive financial data.## Risks and Mitigations- Risk: The system may generate false alarms, leading to unnecessary investigations and increased workload for financial analysts.- Mitigation: The system should be designed to minimize false alarms by using a combination of rule-based and machine learning-based approaches, with regular reviews and updates of the rules and criteria.- Risk: The system may face data privacy and security risks, given the sensitive nature of financial data.- Mitigation: The system should adhere to industry best practices for data privacy and security, including encryption, access controls, and regular security audits and updates.## Implementation Plan1. Define the database schema for storing rules and criteria for suspicious activity and claims events.2. Implement RESTful API endpoints for generating real-time alerts and handling user actions.3. Integrate MongoDB with defined schemas and collections optimized for performance.4. Develop the frontend using React.js, with UI components and state management using Redux or Context API.5. Integrate Eureka or Consul for service discovery and Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration management.6. Document APIs using Swagger/OpenAPI, with versioning and deprecation strategies in place.7. Conduct regular reviews and updates of the rules and criteria to minimize false alarms and improve accuracy.8. Conduct regular security audits and updates to ensure data privacy and security.";
